 The inset or outset margins for the edges of the text content drawing rectangle.

 Use this property to resize and reposition the effective drawing rectangle for the text content. You can specify a
 different value for each of the four insets (top, left, bottom, right). A positive value shrinks, or insets, that
 edgeâ€”moving it closer to the center of the button. A negative value expands, or outsets, that edge. Use the
 `UIEdgeInsetsMake` function to construct a value for this property.

 The default value is `UIEdgeInsetsZero`.

 Use this property to resize and reposition the effective drawing rectangle for the clear button content. You can
